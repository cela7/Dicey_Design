# Dicey_Design

Submission for 2020 Tyler Tech Maine App Challenge. Built in Java using libGDX and Box2D. This is a game centered around using various shaped blocks in order to build a tower
1000 meters tall. There are four different starting platforms to build on, and three different ways to play the game: the standard mode where you can only let a maximum of
three blocks fall, a free build mode where there are no restrictions on block type and no penalties for dropping blocks, and a wind mode where you play with a varying amount
of wind that can blow your tower down. The source for this project has been provided here.
